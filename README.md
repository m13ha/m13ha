Hi there! 👋

I'm a Front-end Developer with over 3 years of experience in Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 💻 I'm well-versed in responsive design and object-oriented programming. 🔍 I'm passionate about innovation and problem-solving through technology.


🌱 Currently, I'm working on a React app to help people better understand data structures and how they work. I'm always looking for ways to learn and improve my skills. 🚀 That's why I'm currently learning React.

📝 I regularly write about things I learn on dev.to. 📖

Some of my other skills include JQuery, JSON, JavaScriptMVC, Ajax, Git, and Mongodb. 💪

Feel free to reach out to me at nwaokocham@gmail.com if you have any questions or just want to connect. 😊
